Xpacket - the porpular Packet-Radio Terminal

These are the original Sources from dl6ib. The original homepage of xpacket is http://www.dl6ib.de/xpacket In late 2008 the idea came up to port xpacket to modern operating systems and make it os independent. Badly nobody had the time. Xpacket is written in TurboPascal - Maybe it compiles with FreePascal. 73 de DLM274
